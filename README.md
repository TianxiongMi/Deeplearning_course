Distinguish human actions: talking to people and talking on phone <br />
This post uses Pytorch to write a stacked LSTM RNN neural network to distinguish the two actions. <br />
The original json files can be transformed by read_json.py <br />
The two csv files can be directly used in deeplearning_homework to get training result. <br />

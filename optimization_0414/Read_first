This is an optimized model for my deep learning course </br>
The optimization include: </br>
  1) Add face data into account </br>
  2) Make some parameter optimization: greatly increase the number of epochs, hidden units and layer length, and store the best model during training </br>
Some more data, including one csv files of 'talking to people', and the weights and bias file are stored in a google drive, please check the following link: </br>

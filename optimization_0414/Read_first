This is an optimized model for my deep learning course 
The optimization include: 
  1) Add face data into account (a modified version of read_json script has been added) 
  2) Make some parameter optimization: greatly increase the number of epochs, hidden units and layer length, and store the best model during training 
Some more data, including one csv files of 'talking to people', and the weights and bias file are stored in a google drive, please check the following link:
